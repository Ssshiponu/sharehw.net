ShareHW.net is a web application designed to simplify homework sharing for college students, offering a collaborative platform where "captains or captain-approved students" can upload homework, ensuring easy access for all students in the class. This app is particularly helpful for those who may have missed classes or forgotten their homework. With a clean, intuitive design, ShareHW.net version 1.0.0 is developed by Mohin Uddin Shipon, a student of Dhamrai Govt. College, currently studying in class XI, Science-B section, roll number 241182. The platform features role-based authentication with four main user roles: student, captain, admin-student, and admin. When a user signs up as an admin-student, a request is sent to the captain of their class for approval. Upon approval, they can upload homework, but without approval, they can only view homework. Similarly, if someone signs up as a captain, a request is sent to the admin for approval. Non-password accounts are created automatically for students with a session duration of two years, allowing for multiple accounts with the same roll number to be replaced with new ones. In contrast, password accounts (for captains and admin-students) require a minimum 8-character password and expire after 30 days. For signing up, the required fields include full name, college roll number (6 digits), class (dropdown with options XI or XII), section (dropdown with Science, Arts, or Commerce and their subsections), and role selection (as a card with radio buttons for student, captain, or admin-student). For password accounts, an image of the student ID card and a new password are mandatory. The admin panel is accessible through a hidden URL (https://sharehw.net/admin), where any visitor sees a blank page with only a password input field. The admin password is Sshiponkarimuddin, granting access to manage captains and admin-students. The admin can add or remove captains and students and manage all aspects of the platform. Captains can view all homework, upload new homework, and approve admin-student requests. Admin-students can upload homework and view all class homework, while regular students can only view homework. The homework upload form includes a subject dropdown (covering common subjects such as Bangla, English, ICT, and specific streams like Science, Arts, and Commerce), teacher name, description, due date (allowing only past 8 days), and attachments (max file size of 8MB). Uploaded homework is saved in the database with fields for subject, teacher name, description, due date, attachments, student name, roll number, class, section, submission date, and time. Students can search for homework by date (restricted to past dates) and by selecting class and section. The user interface follows a clean, minimalistic, and mobile-first design using Bootstrap, with black and white color themes and animated elements for a better user experience. The header features a logo in the left corner and a navigation icon on the right. The captain dashboard includes a notification dot indicating pending student approvals. The technology stack consists of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Flask, and GitHub for version control. Additional features and technologies may be integrated as needed to enhance functionality and scalability.
